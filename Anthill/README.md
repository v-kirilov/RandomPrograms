Summary:
Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. The purpose of this assignment is for our technical team to understand your skills in the requested tech stack, as well as to delve deeper into your experience so far. The next step would be for you to complete the task (below) within two or three days, followed by a technical interview (c. 45min – 1hr) where one of our senior colleagues will have questions about the take-home assignment, as well as your previous experience.

Task:

Design a relational database to store the results of a basketball league. There is a home team, and away team that are playing.
Add 6 teams to the database.
Add random results, about 20.
 
Create an Angular application with .NET backend communicating to the database that will have the following functionality:
 
There is a navigation menu that allows you to choose one of the following views:
 
1. List of all Teams (sortable/searchable is a plus)
2. Match results in the form of:
Home team    | Away team            | Score
--------------------------------------------------------------
Phoenix Suns | New Orleans Pelicans | 112:97
 
3. Top 5 Best offensive teams (teams who scored the maximum number of points home and away combined)
4. Top 5 Best defensive teams (teams whose opponents scored the smallest number of points, home and away combined)
5. Show the highlight match (Most points scored on a single match by both teams)
 
Important notes:
•	You can use UI components of your choice
•	All the database queries should be in a form of SQL Server stored procedures returning the result.
•	Stored procedures themselves can be triggered via Entity Framework or other ORM of choice.
